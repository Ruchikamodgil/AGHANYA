### About Aghanya

As nowadays, street cameras are present mostly on every road. So, with the use of that and AI we will detect the presence of cattle on roads and will show them on map.
If a user watches a cow or traffic jam or accidents caused by cows then they can report it by using our app. App has a specially designed AI camera which will predict the presence of cow in  the image and will report a complaint with the latest timestamps and location of user. This feature is for effortless reporting.User app also have one map which will show the cows present in nearby area.
Special application for authorities so that they can receive all complaints from user and the reports from cctv camera.

####  MAP for showing Live Locations in both Admin and user APP

We have used maps for showing the live locations so that the user can take easy idea about the presence of cattle on roads so, that accidents and jams can be easily avoided.
Basically the location is of the GPS location of CCTV cameras and the GPS location of the mobile of the user where the cattle is detected.
Although there is slight difference in the information that is to be shown on the common user and admin.
Admin will also have a track of animal catching vans through the same map.
